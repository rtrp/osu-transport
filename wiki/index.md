# Available Software
Some software available through [Citrix](http://it.engineering.oregonstate.edu/citrix).

## Code Reference Resources
* [C++](http://www.learncpp.com/)
* [Python3](https://docs.python.org/3/), [Python2](https://docs.python.org/2/)
* [MATLAB](http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/)
* [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) - what this website was written in ::
* And most importantly.... [Google](https://www.google.com/)
  -  Leads to StackExchange mostly. *Can* be a great reference and a cool place to ask the programming community questions.


## Simulation Tools
A brief and non-exhaustive list of software NSE has access to. Please note that some of these are export controlled software and require proper permissions. If you need access to them, just ask.

##### Rogue (NSE Linux Workstation)
* [Attila](https://www.varian.com/x-ray-imaging-components/products/security-industrial-imaging/attila-software-suite) - Radiation Transport
* [CASMO/SIMULATE](http://www.studsvik.com/sv/Verksamhetsomraden/Bransle--och-materialteknik/Programvara-for-bransleoptimering/In-Core-Fuel-Management/CASMO5/) - LWR Lattice Physics and Fuel Management
* [MCNP 5/6/X](https://mcnp.lanl.gov/) - General Monte Carlo Transport
* [MOOSE](http://mooseframework.com/) - General Purpose PDE Solver
* [OpenMC](https://mit-crpg.github.io/openmc/)  - Monte Carlo Transport focused on neutron criticality problems
* [PARCS](http://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/regulatory/research/safetycodes.html) - Reactor Kinetics
* [SCALE](http://scale.ornl.gov/) - Safety Analysis and Design
* [SERPENT](http://montecarlo.vtt.fi/) - Monte Carlo Reactor Physics

## Math Tools
* [MATLAB](http://it.engineering.oregonstate.edu/site-license-matlab)
* [MFEM](mfem.org) - finite element library

## Documentation Tools
* [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/)
  - Fantastic software for typing technical documents. A local favorite in regards to editing GUI's is [Texmaker](http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/).
  - When you are feeling collaborative (or are forced to for course work) and still want to use LaTeX, [ShareLaTeX](https://www.sharelatex.com) is another great resource.
  - Doug Woods has been kind enough to supply a [LaTeX Demo](../users/woodsdou/LatexDemo.zip) for new users to learn tex.
* [Beamer](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/beamer?lang=en)
  - A tool to create technical presentations that is based on LaTeX.
  - If you want to get into beamer, feel free to check out this [reference](./references/beameruserguide.pdf) and the [example](../users/woodsdou/DougsDefense.zip) that Doug Woods has provided.
* [BibDesk](http://bibdesk.sourceforge.net)
  - Bibliography manager. It was developed to be used in sync with LaTeX.
* [Authorea](http://www.authorea.com)
  - A new(er) piece of software that definitely seems interesting!

## Version Control
* [GitHub](http://www.github.com)
  - Your one-stop-shop for version control. Students can obtain a paid, premium account for free through [GitHub's education](https://education.github.com/) program.  
  - The learning curve for using Git effectively can be a little daunting. Thankfully, GitHub has [free training](https://services.github.com/training/). Myself (Tony) and a few others took the GitHub for Developer's training and it is a *game changer*.

## Editors
There are *countless* text editors out there. It's really just finding which one works best for you. Here are a few of our (the admins) favorites.
* [Atom](https://atom.io/)
  - Open source. Developed and maintained by GitHub. It really shines if you start using GitHub...
  - Used for local edits.
* [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)
  - Can be used for local or remote editing. Native to most command line settings.
  - Really great to use once you learn how to use it. But it does have a fairly steep learning curve.
* [VIM](http://www.vim.org/)
  - A standard command line based editor.
  
## Visualization Tools
* [VisIt](https://wci.llnl.gov/simulation/computer-codes/visit/)
  - Open source.
