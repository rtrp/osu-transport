The blackboard can contain specialized infrastructures which ease the reading and writing process for large problems.\n",

        "*   Knowledge Agents: Contain specialized expertise in a problem and contribute to solving the problem at large with their specific piece of knowledge. For a multi-physics problem, this could be solving a set of equations with different methods or solving different sets of equation.\n",
