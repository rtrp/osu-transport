        "MARS is flexible regression analysis tool which searches for interactions and non-linear relationships, while ultimately trying to maintain as simple of a relationship as possible.\n",
        "This work utilizes `py-earth`, which is a python adaption of Friedmans's MARS [Fri91].\n",
        "Often times these models can be described as linear models in a higher dimensional basis space.\n",
        "Each term in the model corresponds to a hinge function, where hinge functions are 0 everywhere except where it is equal to its argument.\n",
        "This means each model represents a portion of the overall function, where the linear combination of these models creates the full function.\n",
        "\n",
        "The algorithm consists of two stages.\n",
        "The first stage is considered the forward pass which attempts to minimized the squared error loss in the data. \n",
        "This typically will overfit the data and as such a backwards (or pruning) pass is implemented. \n",
        "This selects s subset of terms which produce a locally minimal generalized cross-validation score, which penalizes complexity in the model.\n",
        "The final results creates basis function that is non-linear in the original space and is likely to generalize to the problem set well.\n",
