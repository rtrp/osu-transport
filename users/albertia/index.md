I am a 4th year graduate student here at OSU in Corvallis, OR working under the guidance of Todd Palmer. I began graduate school in January of 2014 and have been a full time student since. I defended my Masters of Science degree in October of 2015 and published my Masters thesis (see publications below) shortly thereafter.

Since then, I have been pursuing my Doctoral degree in *a priori* parametric model reduction. In spite of progress made in mathematical methods and computer science, many problems in Nuclear Engineering suffer from what is known as the "curse of dimensionality".

One relevant example is the solution of a nuclear reactor dynamics problem with deterministic treatments of each of the phase space variables. The solution, neutron population as a function of time, has 7 unknowns; 3 in space, 2 in direction of flight, 1 in energy, and 1 in time. Couple that with a coarse mesh of say, $$ 10^3 $$, and the solution has $$ 10^{21} $$ degrees of freedom.

You can find a short, two page abstract of this work [here](./files/SIAM_DR17_Abstract_Alberti.pdf).

I have interned at Idaho National Laboratory (INL) in Idaho Falls, ID in the summer of 2015 and 2016. At INL I worked with the Rattlesnake/MAMMOTH Reactor Physics and Analysis group, specifically under the guidance of Javier Ortensi.

### Other Interests
Rock climbing, frontcountry and backcountry camping, hiking, grilling, off roading, and general outdoors adventures.  Music. Lots of music.  I'm a beginner in woodworking and enjoy doing minor auto repairs on my '99 Toyota 4Runner. I also enjoy casual sport shooting. Traveling and just generally exploring new places is also something I genuinely enjoy doing.
