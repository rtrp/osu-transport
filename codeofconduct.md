# Code of Conduct

All members of the research group are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Additionally, we collectively agree 
to enforce this code. We are expecting cooperation from all members to help ensuring a safe environment for everyone.

## The Quick Version

This research group is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender 
identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), 
or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of group members or other colleagues in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not 
appropriate for any professional setting, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Research group members 
violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the group at the discretion of Todd Palmer.

## The Less Quick Version

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, 
physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, 
stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of the research environment, talks, or other events, 
inappropriate physical contact, unwelcome sexual attention, or creation of an otherwise sexualized environment.

Group members asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a member engages in harassing behavior, other group members and Todd Palmer may take any action they deem appropriate to stop this behavior, 
including warning the offender or expulsion from the group and sactioning through official Oregon State University channels.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact Todd Palmer immediately. 
Todd Palmer is available to help group members contact security or local law enforcement, navigate official University reporting channels, 
or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe in the research environment.

If Todd is the cause of the concern or you would prefer he not be involved, official concerns can be addressed by contacting OSU's Equal Opportunity and Access office, or the OSU Office of Institutional Diversity.

We expect research group members to follow these rules in all professional settings including the office, conferences, workshop venues, 
and group-related social events. We additionally expect members to treat each other professionally with respect to their work and workspaces, 
with constructive criticism, without dismissive behavior, and without disruption of shared working spaces.
